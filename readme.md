# YourSpace Theme

*A theme built in 2020 but meant for 2006.*

I built this theme early in the pandemic. Since then I've been slowly toying away with it. I got an email recently asking me to release it, so I figured I would.

It's based on the Underscores theme.

## How do I edit this theme?

All of the stylesheets are written in SCSS and in the /scss directory. I've included a gulpfile that automatically compiles/minifies the scss and JS. You should be able to download the theme, run `npm install` to install the correct dependencies and then just run `gulp` to start the file watching and compiling process.

You don't *need* to edit the source files. I've included Customizer options for all of the colors, and the theme supports custom backgrounds, so if you're just looking for some quick customizations you can do those right through WordPress.
